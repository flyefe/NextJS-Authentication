Plan for Admin Route Management UI
================================================


1. Backend
----------

You already have a `Route` model.
I'll add API endpoints for:

*   Listing all routes
*   Creating a route
*   Editing a route
*   Deleting a route

All endpoints will be admin-protected (JWT + `isAdmin` field on user).


2. Frontend
------------

Create `/admin/routes` page.
UI features:

*   List all routes
*   Add new route (form)
*   Edit existing route (form)
*   Delete route (button)

Only accessible by admin users (middleware + UI check).


Step 1: Add API Endpoints for Route Management
--------------------------------------------

Let's start by creating the API routes under `/api/admin/routes/`:

*   `GET /api/admin/routes` - List all routes
*   `POST /api/admin/routes` - Create new route
*   `PUT /api/admin/routes/[id]` - Update route
*   `DELETE /api/admin/routes/[id]` - Delete route

All endpoints will:

*   Check for a valid JWT in cookies
*   Verify the user is an admin (`isAdmin: true` in user model)


Step 2: Build the Admin UI
-------------------------

Create a new page: `/src/app/admin/routes/page.tsx`

*   Display all routes in a table


Plan for Admin Route Management UI
1. Backend
You already have a Route model.
I’ll add API endpoints for:
Listing all routes
Creating a route
Editing a route
Deleting a route
All endpoints will be admin-protected (JWT + isAdmin field on user).
2. Frontend
Create /admin/routes page.
UI features:
List all routes
Add new route (form)
Edit existing route (form)
Delete route (button)
Only accessible by admin users (middleware + UI check).
Step 1: Add API Endpoints for Route Management
Let’s start by creating the API routes under /api/admin/routes/:

GET /api/admin/routes – List all routes
POST /api/admin/routes – Create new route
PUT /api/admin/routes/[id] – Update route
DELETE /api/admin/routes/[id] – Delete route
All endpoints will:

Check for a valid JWT in cookies
Verify the user is an admin (isAdmin: true in user model)
Step 2: Build the Admin UI
Create a new page: /src/app/admin/routes/page.tsx
Display all routes in a table
Provide forms for adding and editing
Provide delete buttons
Let’s start by checking your current API directory structure to see where to add these endpoints.

c:\Users\EFE\Documents\NextAuth\NextJS-Authentication\src\app\api
Your current API structure under src/app/api only has a users directory. To keep things organized and scalable, I recommend creating a new directory:
src/app/api/admin/routes/
This will house all the route management endpoints.

Next Steps
1. Create API Endpoints
src/app/api/admin/routes/route.ts (for GET and POST)
src/app/api/admin/routes/[id]/route.ts (for PUT and DELETE)
Each endpoint will:

Parse the JWT from cookies
Check if the user is an admin (isAdmin: true)
Perform the requested operation (CRUD)
2. After API: Build the Admin UI
Once the backend is ready, I’ll guide you through creating the /admin/routes page and components.

Let’s proceed by creating the API endpoints for route management.
Would you like to see the code for all four endpoints at once, or step-by-step (GET/POST first, then PUT/DELETE)?
